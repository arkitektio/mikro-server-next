Mikro is the Arkitekt go to solution for all things microscopy. It provides
the datamodels and services for managing microscopy data, and connects a binary
storage system built around S3 object store (in a standard deploylement powered [Minio](https://min.io/)), with a relational
database [Postgres](https://postgressql.org) for metadata storage.

As an API first system, Mikro exposes a GraphQL API for all of its operations that
can be used by any client. It also provides a web based admin UI for interacting with
the system through a browser.

> [!NOTE]  
> What you are currently looking at is the next version of Mikro. Mikro is currently under development and not ready for production. If you are looking for the current version of Mikro, you can find it [here](https://github.com/arkitektio/mikro-server).

## Roadmap

This is the current roadmap for the merging of the new version of Mikro into the main repository:

- [X] Build around the new Arkitekt Stack (Django, Strawberry GraphQL)
- [X] Complete Audit Logging 
- [X] Comlete History Management (return to older version of Image)
- [X] Zarr.less (still handled zarr, but without the zarr dependency (direct metadta handling for better performance)
- [X] Views as central Data Model (more flexible than attaching metadata directly to an Image)
- [ ] Endpoints for on-the-fly OME NGFF conversion (generating metadata from db)
- [X] Ditch Social Features for central handling in Lok
- [ ] Direct OMERO transpilation
- [ ] CI/CD Pipeline (testing against both old and new apps)
- [ ] Documentation
