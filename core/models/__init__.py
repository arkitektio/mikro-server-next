"""Django models for the core app, split by domain.

Every public name is re-exported here so that ``from core import models``
and ``from core.models import X`` keep working everywhere (including
migrations, which reference e.g. ``core.models.create_default_color``).
"""

# Re-exported store models: the old monolithic ``core/models.py`` imported
# these at module level, and code such as ``core/filters.py`` and the
# mutations access them as ``models.ZarrStore`` etc.
#
# Dependency rule between the apps: core may depend on datalayer models (they
# are FK targets of Image/File/Table and re-exported here for convenience),
# but datalayer must never import core — it is the storage backend, agnostic
# of the domain on top of it (guarded by tests/test_architecture.py). All
# runtime storage I/O goes through ``datalayer.datalayer.get_current_datalayer()``,
# never through boto3/zarr directly.
