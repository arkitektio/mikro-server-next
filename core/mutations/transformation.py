"""Mutations for the edges of the coordinate graph.

This is where registration lives now. It used to be a 4x4 matrix on the layer,
which meant two layers over one dataset carried two copies of one fact and were
free to disagree; it is now a single edge between two coordinate systems -- and
under RFC-6 that edge is *the* truth: unique per (data-tree, shared space), so
authoring it places the data in every scene over that space, with no membership
to declare. Refining it is `updateTransformation`, in place and audited; a
genuine alternative registers into a fork of the space, never a rival row here.

Direction is always forward: input to output. Registration libraries routinely
hand you the inverse, so normalize before you call these -- there is deliberately
no flag to record which way round a matrix runs, because half the graph would
end up pointing the wrong way and nothing would tell you.
