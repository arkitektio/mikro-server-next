"""Provenance and ownership context for object creation.

The write-side counterpart to :mod:`core.scoping`: reads are tenant-scoped
through ``for_org``/``get_for_org``; writes stamp ownership (creator,
organization, membership) and task provenance (created_through,
created_through_by) from a single :class:`CreationContext` built once per
mutation instead of repeating ``info.context.request.*`` and
``get_or_create_task()`` plumbing at every call site.

Ownership kwargs stay explicit at each ``objects.create`` call because models
differ in which fields they carry (e.g. ``Era`` has an organization but no
creator/membership). Only the always-identical ``created_through`` pair is
bundled in :meth:`CreationContext.provenance_kwargs`.
